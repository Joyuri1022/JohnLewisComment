It’s about the words we don’t always know how to say- The teenage son choosing a record isn’t just a gift, it’s a bridge.

There’s a strong men’s emotional health thread running through this. Men are often raised to 'hold it together', 'be strong', 'say less'. The skill and the compassion is in noticing. That’s what this advert captured for me. Don't get me wrong, I was also taken back to the '90's - my gosh it hit a nerve and I downloaded 'the record' ⁠immediately :D but what I loved was the point about recognition, empathy, and the quiet bravery of care.

@rinbeans,"John Lewis, you've absolutely smashed it for me this year. 

I’m 46, and lately I’ve been looking back a lot… my younger self, my rave days, the freedom, the late nights.
I miss it more than I expected.

These last few years have been rough.
My mental health took a dip and it affected my kids.
My youngest and I have had the hardest time.
My career took over much of my parenting and I missed more than I want to admit.

But life has a way of giving us a second chance.
This past year he’s had his own struggles, and somehow that opened a space for both of us to heal.
He’s helped me.
I’ve helped him.
We’ve met each other again.

And the funny thing is — we found our way back through music.
House music.
The beats of my younger days.
We share songs, talk about memories, dance in the kitchen, gone to gigs
Different generations, same rhythm.

To me, that’s what parenting — and Christmas — is about.
Not being perfect.
Not getting it all right the first time.
But finding a way to reconnect, laugh again, and love each other in real, everyday ways.

Here’s to second chances.
To softer hearts.
To music that carries us home.

@RebeccaBradshaw-t7o,I think this is rather beautiful and beautifully cast and acted. For me I think there are a mix of meanings running through. I see the main story being that the dad is rather sad and reflects on raising his son and now the son being older. Perhaps he is feeling distant from him or the life they live is not what it was. Burdens of the now are real and life is.more difficult. So the son does what children do best; he shows loves and gives the dad hope by 'taking him back to a happier time'. He then helps the dad maybe grappling with age and to let go of his youth and reconnect with what is important now; his family. The passing of time with its joy and sadness eh; so lovely to capture this for all us parents. The joy of children and love and the sadness of loss and ageing. There's always time to dance and have a hug with the ones we love. The best tune chosen too!
