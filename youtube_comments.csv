@MsJosiJo,"JL for me:

It’s about the words we don’t always know how to say- The teenage son choosing a record isn’t just a gift, it’s a bridge.

There’s a strong men’s emotional health thread running through this. Men are often raised to 'hold it together', 'be strong', 'say less'. The skill and the compassion is in noticing. That’s what this advert captured for me. Don't get me wrong, I was also taken back to the '90's - my gosh it hit a nerve and I downloaded 'the record' ⁠immediately :D but what I loved was the point about recognition, empathy, and the quiet bravery of care.

The tone was perfect and the use of memory of the son from baby to toddler to teenager is powerful stuff.

@rinbeans,"John Lewis, you've absolutely smashed it for me this year. 

I’m 46, and lately I’ve been looking back a lot… my younger self, my rave days, the freedom, the late nights.
I miss it more than I expected.

These last few years have been rough.
My mental health took a dip and it affected my kids.
My youngest and I have had the hardest time.
My career took over much of my parenting and I missed more than I want to admit.

But life has a way of giving us a second chance.
This past year he’s had his own struggles, and somehow that opened a space for both of us to heal.
He’s helped me.
I’ve helped him.
We’ve met each other again.

And the funny thing is — we found our way back through music.
House music.
The beats of my younger days.
We share songs, talk about memories, dance in the kitchen, gone to gigs
Different generations, same rhythm.

To me, that’s what parenting — and Christmas — is about.
Not being perfect.
Not getting it all right the first time.
But finding a way to reconnect, laugh again, and love each other in real, everyday ways.

Here’s to second chances.
To softer hearts.
To music that carries us home.

@sidpheasant7585,"The ad plays around with the notion of Father and Son, while deploying the terms ""words"" and ""gift"". The Alison Limerick song is meanwhile ""Where  love lives"" - a Club hit from 1992. That's a gap of 33 years to now, the typical number of years on Earth ascribed to the Saviour, the word made flesh, the Son of the Father who rose again and delivered the most loving gift of eternal life to all of us. The album originally including the song was 'And Still I rise"" - a title that (also) honours the poem of the late Maya Angelou - a taster of various faiths before deciding on Christianity.

When I showed him this ad he said it was one of the first vinyls he played. This is how you get customers!

@pt4005,"I see it as before he had children and a family, his life and joy revolved around raving and that carefree lifestyle. Once he became a father, everything changed-those experiences were left behind as his priorities shifted toward his responsibilities. But through the present and the music, he was taken back to that part of himself, reminded of what he once loved. Then came the realisation that this part of his life had faded when he became a dad. Yet, having his son recognise and connect with that passion-sharing that moment together-was deeply meaningful, because his son is now his whole world.",0,2025-11-06T10:55:45Z
@nicolaatkins2348,"44 year old Mum to an almost teenager and an 8 year old, and I think this is supposed to represent the fun of a lost youth, which pales into insignificance when you have your babies and they change your world - the most important thing is the world you’ve made with your children, everything else is secondary. The son has bought the record to remind the Dad of his younger days, but no matter how good those days were, the days that came after, with him in the world, were so much more precious. And the Dad clearly appreciates the silent gesture, as your children reach those teenage and pre-teen years, they communicate less and less, but the son is letting the gift speak for him. It’s such a lovely touching advert. Probably the best one JL have done yet.",4,2025-11-06T10:49:50Z

I’ve read so many positive and negative comments. I get it. We live in Britain, the UK whatever you want to call us and no matter what, there always someone unhappy or got an opinion. Fair play, I understand BUT what I love about this ad is that JL have approached the Christmas d in such a different way. Made it more emotional and real .. not necessarily encouraged us to spend on their website but I know there will be so many out there who were born on the 70’s, raised in the 80’s and raved in the 90’s and this will be a positive reminder see or trigger to share those amazing experiences we had. Best gift ever .. telling those stories and sharing the music that made us so happy and still does .. I felt no need to suddenly buy from their website .. it made me want to get my tape deck out and play my 90’s tracks to my 13 yer old and tell him about life without phones, social media, meeting friends without texting .. you just knew they’d be there .. the time of that Alison Limerick track was amazing .. I know some won’t get it but I do feel a whole lot of you will ..and it just prompts you to share your good times and memories and have quality time chattering .. best gift ever JL!!

@RebeccaBradshaw-t7o,I think this is rather beautiful and beautifully cast and acted. For me I think there are a mix of meanings running through. I see the main story being that the dad is rather sad and reflects on raising his son and now the son being older. Perhaps he is feeling distant from him or the life they live is not what it was. Burdens of the now are real and life is.more difficult. So the son does what children do best; he shows loves and gives the dad hope by 'taking him back to a happier time'. He then helps the dad maybe grappling with age and to let go of his youth and reconnect with what is important now; his family. The passing of time with its joy and sadness eh; so lovely to capture this for all us parents. The joy of children and love and the sadness of loss and ageing. There's always time to dance and have a hug with the ones we love. The best tune chosen too! The 90s were a great time to be alive!,2,2025-11-05T23:26:17Z

@fontaine9-4,"So, an emotionally stunted man has an insidious and pernicious resentment of his (25 year old?) autistic son because he grew up. The son (a people pleaser due to his father's neglect) mirrors his father's awkwardness and is too scared to hand him the thoughtful gift that he naively hopes will make his father validate him as an autonomous person and love him unconditionally. The father is too selfish to do this and continues to infantalise his son to the point of picturing him as a newborn, albeit now at least showing him some of the affection which has clearly been lacking throughout his life. 

This should be a cautionary tale about fostering healthy relationships with your children so that they don't end up parenting you, like in this advert.

We have a great relationship but can't remember the last time I had a hug from her. It's been the occasional fist bump here and there with a good bit of banter from time to time. For the son in the video to be anticipating his dads response was perfect and then for the Dad to do some dad dancing with the son smiling at the end was great. Also the daughter and mum in the background made it so wholesome. Such a warm, nostalgic and reflective take on parenting teenagers in todays world. Bravo JL.",3,2025-11-05T09:40:37Z

@VoiceOfThe,"I’m 51. House Music was my life in my teens and 20’s. Best moment of the ad 0:31 when the stylus hits the vinyl… 

Class tune - Alison Limerick - Where Love Lives - got it on 12”. 

Thought it was spot on, but, they overdid the schmaltz at the end and it got overly saccharine and cringey reverting to an awful DEI WOKE vocal. 

Why?? Just keep the continuity throughout the advert and grace us with Alison Limerick’s sublime vocal. David Morales deserves recognition too as it’s his mix / production.",1,2025-11-05T04:54:55Z
